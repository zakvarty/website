I loved to read as a child; I was never without a book on the go. When I was two years into my undergradute degree, I realised that I had stopped reading for fun. To counter this I challenged myself to read my age in books every year.

Since then, I have stuck to this challenge most years. I started to keep a record of what I was reading in 2016. This page collates those records.
