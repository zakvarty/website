In the academic years 2017-18 and 2018-19 I co-delivered an introductory course in typesetting, academic writing and poster design using [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/). The course was aimed at undergraduate / masters level students for presenting their summer project / dissertaion. 

The course materials were lightly adapted hand-me-downs and so are not mine to freely distribute. However, they contain lots of useful examples so for ease of access I will be storing them here in password protected documents/folders.

## Overview

* **Online courses**
* **Project or software documentation**
* **Tutorials**

The `courses` folder may be renamed. For example, we can rename it to `docs` for software/project documentation or `tutorials` for creating an online course.

## Delete tutorials

**To remove these pages, delete the `courses` folder and see below to delete the associated menu link.**

## Update site menu

After renaming or deleting the `courses` folder, you may wish to update any `[[main]]` menu links to it by editing your menu configuration at `config/_default/menus.toml`.

For example, if you delete this folder, you can remove the following from your menu configuration:

```toml
[[main]]
  name = "Courses"
  url = "courses/"
  weight = 50
```

Or, if you are creating a software documentation site, you can rename the `courses` folder to `docs` and update the associated *Courses* menu configuration to:

```toml
[[main]]
  name = "Docs"
  url = "docs/"
  weight = 50
```

## Update the docs menu

If you use the *docs* layout, note that the name of the menu in the front matter should be in the form `[menu.X]` where `X` is the folder name. Hence, if you rename the `courses/example/` folder, you should also rename the menu definitions in the front matter of files within `courses/example/` from `[menu.example]` to `[menu.<NewFolderName>]`.
