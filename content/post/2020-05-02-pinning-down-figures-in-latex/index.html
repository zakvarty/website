<!-- what is LaTeX -->
<blockquote>
<p>One quick thing before you read all of this. LaTeX, or more properly <span class="math inline">\(\LaTeX\)</span>, is not pronounced like “latex”. Odd, I know. The <span class="math inline">\(TeX\)</span> part of the word LaTeX comes from the greek <span class="math inline">\(\tau \acute{\epsilon} \chi\nu\eta\)</span> meaning art, craftsmanship, or style. The X on the end is therefore a capital chi (lowercase <span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span>), meaning that LaTeX should be pronounced “lay-tech” and rhymes with the word neck.</p>

<div id="latex-what-is-it-and-why-use-it" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="math inline">\(\LaTeX\)</span>: what is it and why use it?</h2>
<p>LaTeX is the standard document preparation system for scientific writing. The range of documents that can be produced using LaTeX include: short reports, academic papers, lecture notes, books, presentations and posters. When making these documents LaTeX serves a similar purpose as a word processor but with one important distinction. The content of the document (the words, equations and pictures) are treated separately from the presentation of the document (fonts, layout, paper dimensions, referencing style).</p>
<p>The separation of content and style make LaTeX a very powerful tool that allows you to focus on the document content while writing and leave someone else (or future you) to worry about how to make that look appealing. This separation gives an easy way for academic journals or book publishers to achieve a consistent `look’ or feel across all of their products.</p>
<p>LaTeX is also particularly good for typesetting maths and for handling references, which make it a treasure of the academic community. External references are separated from the referencing style (APA, Harvard etc.) allowing this style to be easily changed. Internal references to figures, sections or chapters are separated from the order that the referenced elements appear in the document. This means that you can add in an extra figure or swap the order of two chapters without the pain of spending hours re-numbering everything afterward.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-problem-with-floats" class="section level2">
<h2>The problem with floats</h2>
<p>LaTeX takes your content and arranges it in a (hopefully) pleasing way on the page. It creates titles, headings, cross-references and a bibliography in the requested format and adjusts the location of figures and tables within the text so that they fit nicely on the page. These moveable elements are enclosed in floating environments, with the figure and table environments being the two most frequently used types of float.</p>
<pre><code>  \begin{figure}[]
    \includegraphics[width = 0.8\textwidth]{./path_to/fig.pdf}
    \label{fig:label_text}
    \caption{A floating figure}
  \end{figure}</code></pre>
<!-- why can they be problematic ? -->
<p>Floating environments can be cause a lot of trouble when using LaTeX. While LaTeX is usually good at coming up with reasonable locations for floating environments it is by no means perfect. Sometimes floating environments can end up very far away from where they are created when writing the document.</p>
<p>This leads to two sources of annoyance when creating a long-form documents such as reports or books. Firstly, it means the reader has to do lots of page-flipping to see the figure or table while reading its description. Secondly, and more importantly, floating environments can stray into other parts of the document, appearing in the wrong section or the wrong chapter.</p>
<p>In other circumstances you don’t want LaTeX to be able to move floating environments at all. When creating a poster you usually want figures and tables to appear in exactly the place you created them, but you also want the pretty formatting provided by floating environments.</p>
<p>So how do we control or fix the placement of floating environments? There are (at least) three possible ways of doing this.</p>
</div>
<div id="solution-1-float-placement-specifiers" class="section level2">
<h2>Solution 1: float placement specifiers</h2>
<p>When creating a floating environment you can add placement specifiers to say where that float is allowed to appear. These go in square brackets after beginging the float.</p>
<pre><code>   \begin{figure}[htbp!]
    \includegraphics[width = 0.8\textwidth]{./path_to/fig.pdf}
    \label{fig:label_text}
    \caption{A floating figure}
  \end{figure}</code></pre>
<p>The specifiers have the following interpretations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>h</code> float can appear in-line ‘here’, if it fits here;</li>
<li><code>t</code> float can appear at the top of a page or column before the text;</li>
<li><code>b</code> float can appear at the bottom of a page or column after all the text;</li>
<li><code>p</code> float can appear on a new page or column section dedicated to floats;</li>
<li><code>!</code> relaxes rules on the total number and size of floats on a page/column.</li>
</ul>
<p>The order in which you give these does not carry peference, so <code>[tb]</code> will have the same effect as <code>[bt]</code>. Usually setting these to be <code>[htbp!]</code> will keep floats relatively nearby in a long-form document. It doesn’t stop them from flowing over into new sections or chapters though.</p>
<p>You can learn more about the rules determining float placement in this <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/publications/indexbytopic/2e-floats/">paper by the latex project</a> or this <a href="https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/39017/how-to-influence-the-position-of-float-environments-like-figure-and-table-in-lat">stackoverflow post</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="solution-2-the-assertive-here-specifier" class="section level2">
<h2>Solution 2: the assertive-here specifier</h2>
<p>If you want to rigidly place a floating envirionment at a set in-line location, the <code>floats</code> LaTeX package allows this by adding the assertive here-specifier <code>H</code>. To use the <code>floats</code> package add the following line to your preamble (everything that comes before <code>\begin{document}</code>):</p>
<pre><code>\usepackage{floats}</code></pre>
<p>This specifier is not recommended in long documents because it can lead to some pretty funky layouts. For posters though, this can be an ideal solution. The <code>H</code> specifier can provide a useful fix in a short or completed project, where you only need to move around one or two floats.</p>
<p>Using <code>H</code> will ensure that your floats appear in the correct section or chapter of the document but in a brittle way. Forcing float locations so specifically can lead to a lot of awkward blank spaces that need to be fixed further down the line.</p>
</div>
<div id="solution-3-float-barriers" class="section level2">
<h2>Solution 3: float barriers</h2>
<p>A more flexible and robust way to prevent floats from spilling out of their intended part of the document is to use the <code>placeins</code> package. Do this by adding the following to the preamble of your document:</p>
<pre><code>\usepackage[section]{placeins}</code></pre>
<p>This will prevent any floats from being placed ouside of the section in which they are defined. The <code>section</code> here can be lowered to <code>subsection</code>, or raised to <code>chapter</code> depending on the level of flexibility you want to allow (nb: chapters only exist when <code>\documentclass{book}</code> is used). Leave the square brackets empty to allow the usual overflow behaviour again. Larger settings usually result in better outcomes when using the <code>placeins</code> package.</p>
<p>To help the placement of one or two awkward plots the package also provides the <code>\FloatBarrier</code> command. This is used in-line to create an extra barrier beyond which floats can not be placed. This helps to control how far forward floats can move and a similar effect to the <code>H</code> specifier can be achieved by sandwiching a foating environmnet between two <code>\FloatBarrier</code> lines.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>I have covered three ways of avoiding LaTeX woes regarding float placement. I’m sure there are a million other solutions but these three have gotten me past every problem I’ve had so far!</p>
