I am fortunate to have had the opportunity to teach in a variety of roles. These have included:

- one-to-one tuition for high school students;
- running workshops and computer labs for undergraduate and postgraduate modules;
- delivering short courses on scientific communication and LaTeX; 
- supervising an undergraduate research project; 
- co-convenor of masters module in extreme value theory.

Since October 2020 I have been working toward associate fellowship of the Higher Education Academy (learn more [here](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/fellowship/associate-fellowship)) to further develop my teaching practice.
