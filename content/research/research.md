## PhD research topic
My research focuses on point process models, which describe the distribution in time and space of localised events. I consider how these models can be used to describe and predict earthquakes in the Netherlands. 
This process involves modelling the link between gas extraction and the induced earthquake activity.

Gas extraction has historically been variable with demand, which is strongly seasonal and generally increasing over time. This extraction pattern gives additional information that can be drawn into the modelling procedure, that is not typically available for tectonic earthquakes.

Models developed for tectonic seismicity can struggle to represent induced catalogues accurately. This is because of the inherently smaller data sets for induced earthquakes and the variable rate of earthquakes being triggered. I consider how we can develop or adapt earthquake models to make most efficient use of the limited available data and to improve predictive performance.

## Past projects

_A review of simulated annealing techniques:_ Simulated annealing is a metahuristic technique mainly used for combinatorial optimisation. Applications, parallelisation and extensions of the technique were reviewed.

_Inference on censored networks:_ Networks are censored when existing nodes or edges are not observed. Methods for inference under different types of missingness were explored. Master's project supervised by Dr. Christopher Nemeth.

_Computionally intensive methods for modelling houshold epidemics:_
Approximate Bayesian Computation was utilised to allow inference on disease models with intractable likelihoods. Master's dissertation supervised by Prof. Peter Neal.
