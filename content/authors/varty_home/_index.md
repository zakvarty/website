I am a final year PhD student at Lancaster University in the United Kingdom. My research is focused on statistical modelling of earthquakes and combines point process models with techniques from extreme value theory. 

I study as part of a Centre for Doctoral Training, which aims to develop a broader set of skills than a traditional PhD programme and focuses on producing impactful research through collaboration with industry.

When I am not working I love reading both fiction and non-fiction and set myself the annual challenge to read my age in books. The rest of my time is often spent on exercise, travel and baking tasty treats.
