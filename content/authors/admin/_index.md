I am a final year PhD student at Lancaster University in the United Kingdom. I am currently taking four months out from my PhD to work as a statistician with Shell in the Netherlands.

My research is focused on statistical models for seismicity and combines point process models with techniques from extreme value theory. I study as part of a Centre for Doctoral Training, which aims to develop a broader set of skills than a traditional PhD programme and focuses on producing impactful research through collaboration with industry. 

When I am not working I love to read both fiction and non-fiction, as well as to exercise, travel and bake.
