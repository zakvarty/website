I do not like uncertainty, but I do find it exceptionally interesting. That is why I am a statistician.  

I am currently a PhD student at Lancater University. My research is focused on statistical models for seismicity and combines point process models with techniques from extreme value theory. A longer (and less buzz-wordy) description of my research can be found under the academic section. I am studying as part of a Centre for Doctoral Training, which aims to develop a broader set of skills than a traditional PhD programme, focusing on collaboration with industy. 

In addition to my PhD, I have tutored and taught both undergratuate and master's degree level courses. When I am not working I love to read both fiction and non-fiction, to excercise and to bake.
