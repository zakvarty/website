I _loved_ to read as a child; I was never without a book on the go. I realised
when I was two years into my undergradute degree that I had stopped reading for fun. To counter this I challenged myself to read my age in books every year. 

Since then, I have stuck to this challenge most years. I started to keep a record of what I was reading in 2016. My [reading page](../reading) acts as a personal good-reads, take a look!
