## Research Interests
 I am interested in applied statistical modelling for environmental, industrial and public health applications. I use and develop statitistical methods in point process theory, extreme value analyis, and spatial statistics to inform decision-making and to answer questions of scientific interest.

I am about to start the final year of my PhD at Lancaster University. You can read more about my PhD project in the  [STOR-i Centre for Doctoral Training](https://www.lancs.ac.uk/stor-i),

## PhD: Outputs


My research focuses on point process models, which describe the distribution in time and space of localised events. I consider how these models can be used to describe and predict earthquakes in the Netherlands.

My PhD is concerned with modelling induced seismicity by linking gas extraction to earthquake activity. Gas extraction has historically been variable with demand, both fluctuating within years and generally increasing over time. Compared to modelling tectonic earthquakes, this extraction pattern gives additional covariate information that can be drawn into the modelling procedure.

Models currently used for tectonic seismicity can struggle to represent induced catalogues, particularly models that include a non-constant triggering rate and after aftershock component. This is due to trade-off between parameters in the triggering and aftershock processes, as well as the inherently smaller catalogue sizes for induced events.

I consider how we can make most efficient use of the limited data that is available to us and how current models can be adapted so that parameters are more identifiable and predictive performance is improved.
